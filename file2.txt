Techcrunch began in 2005 as a blog about dotcom start-ups in Silicon Valley, but has quickly become


one of the most influential news websites across the entire technology industry. Founder Michael 
Arrington had lived through the internet goldrush as a lawyer and entrepreneur before deciding that
writing about new companies was more of an opportunity than starting them himself. His site is now





ranked the third-most popular blog in the world by search engine Technorati, spawning a mini-empire
of websites and conferences as a result. Business Week named Arrington one of the 25 most influential








people on the web, and Techcrunch has even scored interviews with Barack Obama and John McCain.
